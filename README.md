## Ask Phase

### Business Task

Analyze existing non-Bellabeat product consumer data to identify Bellabeat's areas of opportunity for growth. Specifically, to determine how consumers use health-geared smart devices in their everyday lives and apply these general trends to Bellabeat's customers in order to influence the company's marketing strategies.

### Key Stakeholders
 - *Urška Sršen:* Bellabeat co-founder, Chief Creative Officer
 - *Sando Mur:* Bellabeat co-founder, member of Bellabeat Executive Team
 - *Bellabeat Marketing Analytics Team:* Data analyst team responsible for guiding Bellabeat's marketing strategies.

## Prepare Phase

The data used throughout this project is the "FitBit Fitness Tracker Data" by Möbius on Kaggle (found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit/data)). All the data are stored in CSV files located in the `./data` directory, and each file contains data collected between April 12, 2016 and May 12, 2016 from 30 FitBit users in either long or wide format. 

### Data Limitations

 - The data was collected during a month-long window of time; this is a relatively short amount of time and may not account for seasonal trends in the data.
 - The data being used are almost 8 years old at the time of this case study. Because the data are not up-to-date, they may not reflect more recent trends in the data.
 - The data also suffers from a limited sample size. The central limit theorem (CLT) states that a sample size of at least 30 subjects is generally enough to perform a valid analysis, but making statistically significant observations may be more challenging with the smaller sample size as confidence intervals and other statistical metrics allow for smaller windows of uncertainty when sample sizes are larger.
